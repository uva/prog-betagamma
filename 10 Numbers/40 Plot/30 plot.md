# Plot

Write a program that shows the following graph.

![](plotje4.png)

## Specification

* Create a file called `plot.py` and implement a program that plots a graph of the function $$f(x) = x^x$$ between $$x=0$$ and $$x=1.5$$ with steps of $$0.01$$. Use a blue line for this graph.

* The minimum of the function has to be calculated. Since you have a list of x-values and a list of y-values, you can easily achieve this with a `for`-loop.

* Indicate the minimum of the graph by using a red dot and a text within the graph.

* Use `print` to also display the minimum as text in the terminal, in addition to the text in the graph.

## Hints

* Before plotting, create two lists with correct x- and y-values each.

* Closely examine [the examples](/numbers/plotting).

* When using external libraries it can be very useful to make proper use of Google. Want to know how a certain feature can be achieved in pyplot? Google it! Tip: use the word "example" in your search query.

* To use `matplotlib` you have to import it at the top of your program:

		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

* To use `matplotlib` in the online IDE, you'll need a few extra lines of code:

		import matplotlib
		matplotlib.use('Agg')
		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

* Are you using Windows and presented with errors during plotting? Try this:

		import matplotlib
		matplotlib.use('tkagg')
		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

* Also remember that `^` in Python does not result in exponentiation. Use `**` to correctly calculate a number raised to a power. 

* Can't seem to get the plotting to function properly? Send us a mail!

## Testing

Testing for this assignment is somewhat more difficult, because checkpy cannot judge whether your graph complies with the specification. Whether it is correct or not is for you to determine. Checkpy can test if you've created a graph at all.

    checkpy plot
